# VirtuMaster - Building a Custom Hypervisor with KVM

This project involves creating a custom hypervisor using KVM on Linux to manage virtual machines (VMs). The project includes building a basic VM from scratch, implementing hypercalls for guest OS interactions, and designing a scheduler to manage multiple VMs with fractional time allocation. The primary focus is on understanding x86 hardware virtualization and controlling VM execution using KVM APIs and signals.
